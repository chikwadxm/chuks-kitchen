here's a file that contains numerous pages on the project CHUKS KITCHEN 
i have a home, explore and my orders page that intercat with each other.
NO mobile responsiveness for smaller screen, wasnt able to get that done before thr deadline
PROJECT was done with HTML,CSS and JS (my system encountered some issues. had to abandon using Tailwind which i'm used to)
the Menu Toggle uses JS to expand and collapse the toggle
was unable to use for the adding of products into the myorder page.
